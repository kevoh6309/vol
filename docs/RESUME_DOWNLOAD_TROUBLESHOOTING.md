## üõ†Ô∏è **Diagnostic Steps**

### **Step 1: Check Browser Console**

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try to download resume
4. Look for any error messages

**Common Console Errors:**
```
- "Failed to load resource"
- "CORS error"
- "Network error"
- "JavaScript error"
```

### **Step 2: Check Network Tab**

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try to download resume
4. Look for failed requests

**What to look for:**
- HTTP status codes (200 = success, 404 = not found, 500 = server error)
- Request/response headers
- Response content

### **Step 3: Verify Resume Data**

```bash
# Check if resume exists and has data:
1. Go to "My Resumes" page
2. Click "Edit" on the resume
3. Verify all fields have content
4. Save the resume
5. Try downloading again
```

### **Step 4: Test Different Formats**

```bash
# Try different download formats:
1. Try PDF format first
2. If PDF fails, try Word format
3. If both fail, the issue is likely server-side
```

## üîß **Technical Solutions**

### **For Developers/Advanced Users:**

#### **1. Check Application Logs**
```bash
# View application logs for errors:
tail -f logs/vol.log

# Look for these error patterns:
- "PDF generation failed"
- "Database connection error"
- "User authentication failed"
- "Resume not found"
```

#### **2. Test PDF Generation**
```bash
# Run the test script:
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/test_resume_download.py
```

#### **3. Check Database**
```bash
# Verify resume exists in database:
python -c "
from vol.app import app, db, Resume
with app.app_context():
    resumes = Resume.query.all()
    for r in resumes:
        print(f'ID: {r.id}, Name: {r.name}, User: {r.user_id}')
"
```

#### **4. Test Download Route**
```bash
# Test the download endpoint directly:
curl -H "Cookie: session=YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
     "https://your-domain.com/download-resume/1?format=pdf"
```
